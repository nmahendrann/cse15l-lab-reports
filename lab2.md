# Lab Report 2

* One of the bugs in this lab was in the testreverseinplace method
* This method is supposed to print the input in reverse, but has a bug

## This is an input for the program that doesn't work
```
int[] input1 = {4,0,5};
ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
assertArrayEquals(new int[]{4,0,5},ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
```

## This is an input for the program that works
```
int[] input1 = {1,0,1};
ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,0,1},ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
```
