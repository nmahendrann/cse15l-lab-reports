## Speedrunning Lab

* This was my favorite lab as it was fun to see everyone come up with new techniques to do a set of tasks
* I used some shortcuts like the SSH keys and ctrl r to avoid copy pasting and save some time, bringing my pr to 1 minute 30.
* The most time consuming activity was editing the file in nano, which another group was able to cut down through some command
* However faster than all these methods would be creating a bashscript to instantly do all these tasks.
