# Lab Report 1

## Installing VS code

* First, we had to reset our passwords into a more secure password
* https://password.ucsd.edu/
* The new password had to be more secure and not have out first or last name in it
* The steps given by this link were followed, and a unique zzz replacement was given for our ieng6 login in a later step
* We also had to install VS code if we did not already have it and did not want to use the school computers
* https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* This was a windows machine so the windows installer was used

* In order to connect properly, the zz in the code has to be replaced by the class spcecific code given during the password reset from the first step
* A message is displayed during the first time connecting to the server, and at this point we had to click yes in order to continue
* After a successful connection, this is what the message displayed should look like

* The command used here was ls - lat, which lists all the files in the directory, including any hidden files

* All the commands outputted what was expected, and I didn't run into any errors on this step.

* Once this was completed, this program was exited, either through ctrl D or command `exit`
